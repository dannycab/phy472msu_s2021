## Particle on a sphere - probabilities and expectation values

A particle on a sphere is in the following normalized eigenstate:

$$\ket{\psi} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{1,-1} + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\ket{10} + \dfrac{i}{\sqrt{6}}\ket{00}$$

1. **Question:** What is the probability that a measurement of $L_z$ will yield 2$\hbar$? $-\hbar$? $0\hbar$?
  * **Discussion:** How does degeneracy feature in this determination, if at all? If it doesn't feature, how could it?
2. **Question:** What is the expectation value of $L_z$ in this state?
  * **Discussion:** How does degeneracy feature in this determination, if at all? If it doesn't feature, how could it?
3. **Question:** What is the expectation value of $\mathbf{L}^2$ in this state?
* **Discussion:** How does degeneracy feature in this determination, if at all? If it doesn't feature, how could it?
4. **Question:** What is the expectation value of the energy in this state?
  * **Discussion:** How does degeneracy feature in this determination, if at all? If it doesn't feature, how could it?
5. **Question:** What is the expectation value of $L_y$ in this state? Hint: think spin-1
  * **Discussion:** How does degeneracy feature in this determination, if at all? If it doesn't feature, how could it?
