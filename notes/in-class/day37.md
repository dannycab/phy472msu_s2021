### Perturbing a Three-Level System

Consider a spin-1 system (like a Nitrogen nucleus) that is placed in a constant magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0\hat{\mathbf{z}}$ has a Larmor frequency of $\omega_0$. We perturb this system by turning on another magnetic field $\mathbf{B}' = B_2\hat{\mathbf{x}}$. This perturbation Hamiltonian is characterized by a different Larmor frequency, $\omega_2$.


1. Construct the original Hamiltonian, $H_0$, and the perturbation Hamiltonian, $H'$. Use the matrix representation.
2. What are the original energy eigenvalues?
3. Use Perturbation Theory to determine the first-order energy corrections. What do you notice?
4. Use Perturbation Theory to determine the second-order energy corrections.
5. Draw a sketch of the energy levels and how they are affected by increasing $B_2$. What do you notice about the shape of the curves?
6. Compare and contrast your results here with the results from our [previous in-class activity that used Perturbation Theory](day36.html).
