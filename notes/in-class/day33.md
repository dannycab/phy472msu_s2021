## The QHO and Ehrenfest's Theorem

One of the things we learned in Chapter 5 was that quantum mechanics expectation values follow classical laws (this is the root of [Ehrenfest's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfest_theorem)). In this activity, we will work through some of the mechanics of calculations for a QHO, and use them to verify Ehrenfest's Theorem.

A particle in a harmonic well is found to be in the initial state:

$$\ket{\psi(t=0)} = A \left[\ket{0} + 2e^{i\pi/2}\ket{2}\right]$$

1. We need the time evolved state to calculate any expectation values. Determine $\ket{\psi(t)}$. *Make sure that your state is normalized.*
2. Determine the expectation value of the position, $\braket{x}$. *There are a number of ways to do this, choose one that makes most sense to your group.* Which approach did you choose and why?
3. Determine the expectation value of the momentum, $\braket{p}$. *Again, there are a number of ways to do this, choose one that makes most sense to your group.* Which approach did you choose and why?
4. Show that your expressions satisfy Ehrenfest's Theorem.
