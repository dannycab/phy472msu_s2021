## Where do we need more time/focus/etc?

We are about 4 weeks into the semester and we have covered nearly two chapters of McIntyre! We should pause for a bit and compile issues and questions we have about what we have covered so far. Here's a list of what we have talked about so far:

* Review of Chapters 1-3 (Spin and Formalism)
  * Spin 1/2
  * Spin 1
  * Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenstates
  * Changing Basis
* The Infinite Square Well
* Finite Square Well
* Matching Boundary Conditions
* Delta function potentials
* Free particle states
* Position and momentum space
* Fourier Transforms

In [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qq5DpYLQSdaDB_7FsHv7psqZ-42giYRUIXPcGEYzLxg/edit?usp=sharing), write up questions and concerns that you have about what we have covered so far. Your ideas and questions will feed directly into our class going forward.
