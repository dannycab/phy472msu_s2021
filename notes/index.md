## Week 0

**This week is a "reading week" and MSU is discouraging instructors from assigning graded activities. We are encouraged to have you read and review material relevant to the course.**

For this week, I encourage you strongly to read Chapters 1-4 of McIntyre, which was the main elements of QM last semester. In addition, the activity below should provide a detailed reminder of the main elements of QM 1 that we will draw on in QM 2. *If this formalism and approach are unfamiliar to you, please contact me and I will make time to go over things with you individually this week.*
