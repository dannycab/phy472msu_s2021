Homework 3 dives into bound states for potentials where the wells are no longer infinite. Here the focus is on process, set up, common results, and a few new ideas. In most cases, we must solve these problems numerically, a process that you will explore with a Jupyter notebook.

## 1. Calculate the Energy Eigenstates for a Bound Electron

* Basically McIntyre 5.18, but do some comparison.

## 2. Half-infinite Square Well

* Basically 5.20 from McIntyre, but write out steps and explain

## 3. Orthonormality of functions

* General idea. Look up intervals and weights. Show integrals: Legendre, Hermites, Chebyshev

## 4. Double $\delta$-function potential

* Problem 5.26 from McIntyre, but write out steps -->

## 5. Finding the Eigenenergies of the Finite Square Well Numerically

**You will turn in this question using a [Dropbox file request](https://www.dropbox.com/request/g9rmFf1MHcaPwFWGvmcT). Turn in the notebook, not a PDF of it.**

For this question, download this [Jupyter notebook](./notebooks/Homework3_Problem5_STUDENT.ipynb) and work through the notebook. All the instructions appear in the notebook. The design is such that you are shown how to do some calculation, and then asked to translate that calculation to the problem at hand.
