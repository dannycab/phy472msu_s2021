title: Final Project (Due April 29th at midnight)

Your final project will consist of a 8-10 minute video presentation of some original work or analysis you have done in a quantum mechanical system. You will be asked to work in groups no larger than 3 (you can choose your groups). Every person must contribute to the preparation and presentation. I will create a form to ask you about the contributions of each member and to make sure that each student in the group should be awarded the same grade.

For the project, I have the following expectations:

1. That you work together drawing on each other's strengths to prepare your video presentation.
2. That you presentation consists of some original analysis (theoretical and computational) of some interesting quantum system.
3. That you discuss the background and set up for this analysis.
4. That you provide a full discussion of the analysis and results you have produced.
5. That you provide an associated Jupyter notebook that illustrates your work.

You may choose any topics that you are interested in. Some potential topics include:
* Anything beyond Chapter 10 of McIntyre
* Simulations of multiple quantum bodies
* Exploring common QM numerical analysis to problems (e.g., the shooting method for the square well)
* Applications of what we have learned to new physical systems (e.g., atomic, nuclear, elementary particles)

For grading the assignment, the structure will be:

* 30% - Video Presentation (graded by the Instructor)
* 30% - Explanatory Notebook (graded by the Instructor)
* 15% - Feedback From Other Student Evaluations (you will be asked to review some small number of other students projects)
* 10% - How Well You Reviewed Other Students Evaluations (your feedback will be reviewed for quality and depth)
* 15% - Feedback From Your Group Mates

## Turn-In Procedure

- Your group can turn-in your project anytime before Thursday, April 29th at midnight. To do so, zip up your files (e.g., notebooks, code, slides, video, anything else) and upload it to the [Dropbox file request](https://www.dropbox.com/request/TpydXQKRbVnKGchOdlHE)
- I will review the turn-ins on the morning of April 30th and assign reviews. I will send you an individual email by noon on Friday the 30th with your reviewing assignments. Make sure to check your spam filter!
- Your reviews will be due Sunday May 2nd by midnight. I expect this reviewing to take you 60-90 minutes. This gives you over 48 hours to complete the reviews. To conduct a review, you will [complete this form for every group you are assigned](https://msu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1LmfHHdFY5gc5Tw).
