## What to turn in

### Video and Notebook

Your final project will require that you turn in a video presentation (8-10 minutes) that goes through the project and explains what you did and how you did it. In addition, you will be asked to turn in a Jupyter notebook (or equivalent code/documentation for other languages and tools) that goes into the details of your analysis and reusults.

When you and your group are ready to turn in your work, create a directory that has all your work (video, analysis, notebooks, code, data, etc.). **Make sure that your code can run in that directory (especially if you are using data).** Compress (e.g., zip) the directory and turn it in using this [Dropbox file request](https://www.dropbox.com/request/TpydXQKRbVnKGchOdlHE).

**Let me know ASAP if you run into file size issues.**

### Evaluation of Your Own Work

In addition, I am requesting that each student submit a short paragraph that evaluates their contributions and the contributions of others on the project. For students who are completing projects alone, I ask that you submit an evaluation of your own work. You can turn this in using the same [Dropbox file request](https://www.dropbox.com/request/TpydXQKRbVnKGchOdlHE).

## Grading Procedure

Your grade will be composed of three parts: (1) a review of your work by me (60% of your grade), a review by your peers (30%), and a review of your feedback by me (10%). We will all use the same rubric and have access to the same materials. I will upload your project materials to shared Google Drive (or similar) and send out the requests for review. You are likely to review 3-4 other groups.

For the reviews of your work, we will all use the same rubric (see below). I will grade every project myself, which composes the major fraction of your final project grade. For the peer review, I will collect your feedback for other students via Qualitrics form. I will average your scores on the review by your peers to obtain your grade on that part. In addition, I will review that you completed all review requests in a timely and appropriate manner. If you do so, you will receive full credit on that part. If you do not, I will deduct points for that part.

## Grading Rubric

The rubric consists of six parts, each with its own weight. Grades will be assigned on a 4.0 scale for each part of the rubric, added together according to their weight, and then will be converted to a 100 point scale. In addition, each group will be given some overall feedback from myself and the peer review. Below appears the rubric along with a description of what we are looking for in each category.

### Stating the Problem (10%)

* Exceeds Expectations (4.0) - States problem with compelling discussion of importance, interest, and background.
* Meets Expectations (3.5) - States problem with adequate discussion of importance, interest, and background.
* Nearing Expectations (3.0) - States problem with minimal discussion of importance, interest.
* Does Not Meet Expectations (2.0) - States problem with no additional discussion.
* Missing (0.0) -  Absent, no evidence

### Explaining the Relevant Theory/Model/Approach (25%)

* Exceeds Expectations (4.0) - Clearly and concisely explains the theory/model/approach that is being investigated and how it relates to the physics. Describes assumptions and approximations that are being made.
* Meets Expectations (3.5) - Clearly and concisely explains the theory/model/approach that is being investigated. Describes assumptions and approximations that are being made.
* Nearing Expectations (3.0) - Clearly and concisely explains the models that is being investigated in this poster.
* Does Not Meet Expectations (2.0) - Explains what the symbols in the model mean
* Missing (0.0) - Absent, no evidence

### Performing the Appropriate Calculations/Derivations/Analysis (25%)

* Exceeds Expectations (4.0) - Clearly explains the analysis being done in a way that can be not only followed but reporoduced easily.
* Meets Expectations (3.5) - Clearly explains the analysis being done in a way that can be followed easily.
* Nearing Expectations (3.0) - Explains the analysis being done, but hard to follow, unclear, or otherwise missing aspects.
* Does Not Meet Expectations (2.0) - Conducts analysis.
* Missing (0.0) -  Absent, no evidence

### Presenting your Results (20%)

* Exceeds Expectations (4.0) - Clearly presents figures that demonstrate the results of the analytical and computational modeling conducted. Describes the figure in a concise way and relates it to the underlying physics.
* Meets Expectations (3.5) - Clearly presents figures that demonstrate the results of the analytical and computational modeling conducted. Describes the figure in a concise way.
* Nearing Expectations (3.0) - Figures are presented that result from the modeling and are described in a concise way.
* Does Not Meet Expectations (2.0) - There are figures resulting from the calculations.
* Missing (0.0) -  Absent, no evidence

### Discussing your Findings, Conclusions, and Implications (10%)

* Exceeds Expectations (4.0) - The discussion describes the results in the context of the theory/model and the physics. Limitations and signficances of the work are discussed. Future directions are described that follow from the work that has been completed.
* Meets Expectations (3.5) - The discussion describes the results in the context of the theory/model and the physics. Limitations and signficances of the work are discussed.
* Nearing Expectations (3.0) - The discussion describes the results in the context of the theory/model and the physics.
* Does Not Meet Expectations (2.0) - There is a discussion of the results.
* Missing (0.0) -  Absent, no evidence

### Including Appropriate References/Resources (10%)

* Exceeds Expectations (4.0) - All cited works, both text and visual, are done in the correct format with no errors. Includes more than 5 major references (e.g. science journal articles, books, but no more than two internet sites.)
* Meets Expectations (3.5) - Some cited works, both text and visual, are done in the correct format. Inconsistencies evident. Includes 5 major references (e.g. science journal articles, books, but no more than two internet sites.)
* Nearing Expectations (3.0) - Few cited works, both text and visual, are done in the correct format. Includes 4 major references (e.g. science journal articles, books, but no more than two internet sites.)
* Does Not Meet Expectations (2.0) - Includes 3 major references (e.g. science journal articles, books, but no more than two internet sites.)
* Missing (0.0) -  Absent or the only references are internet sites.
