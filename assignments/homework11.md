## 1. Project Progress Statement

Now that you and your group have decided on your project, and received some feedback and resources on the scope, it would be good to update me on your progress. This assignment makes sure that your work is meeting expectations and so that you and your group make some progress before the last week of classes.

By this time, I would hope that you and your group have:

* Determined the direction of focus of your project
* Reviewed most of the relevant literature
* Begun building your Jupyter notebook

For this assignment I would like a report on your work so far and a copy of your notebook as it stands now. For the report, please include:

* the specific focus of the project,
* the resources you are using including an indication of what you have read and what you need to read yet,
* a discussion of how the collaboration is going: who is doing what and how that is going,
* the challenges you have encountered along the way, and
* a discussion of what is left to do and what you will include or not in your final presentation.
