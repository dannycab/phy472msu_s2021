- Your group can turn-in your project anytime before Thursday, April 29th at midnight. To do so, zip up your files (e.g., notebooks, code, slides, video, anything else) and upload it to the [Dropbox file request](https://www.dropbox.com/request/TpydXQKRbVnKGchOdlHE)
- I will review the turn-ins on the morning of April 30th and assign reviews. I will send you an individual email by noon on Friday the 30th with your reviewing assignments. Make sure to check your spam filter!
- Your reviews will be due Sunday May 2nd by midnight. I expect this reviewing to take you 60-90 minutes. This gives you over 48 hours to complete the reviews. To conduct a review, you will [complete this form for every group you are assigned](https://msu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1LmfHHdFY5gc5Tw).
