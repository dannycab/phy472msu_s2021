## 1. Organize yourself for the project

Now that we have discussed the [Final Project](./finalproject.html), it is time to start getting organized. For this question, please do the following:

* Tell me who is in your group and how you intend to communicate with each other.
* Tell me the scope of your project. What are you intending to investigate and how?
* Tell me about the resources you are intending to draw on. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is fine, but also try to dig a little deeper. [Physics Today](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/journal/pto), [The American Journal of Physics](https://www.aapt.org/publications/ajp/index.cfm), and [The Physics Teacher](https://aapt.scitation.org/journal/pte) are all great physics resources. Of course, you may use other journals. You can access these journals through the [MSU library website](https://lib.msu.edu/), or by setting up [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) to [use the MSU library](https://libguides.lib.msu.edu/ANS409/googlescholar).
* Tell me the timeline you and your group plan to successfully complete your project.
